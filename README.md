## README
This repository contains the code relating to the honours thesis written by Alex Gu under supervision of Dr. Ruth Knibbe, titled *"Predicting Perovskite Formation Energy using Machine Learning in the development of Oxygen Electrode Materials for High Temperature Electrolysis in Solid Oxide Fuel Cells"*.

### Requirements


It is recommended (and generally good programming practice) to develop the code for this project in a seperate environment.




### Overview

* `data_preprocessing.py`
* `feature_importance.py`
