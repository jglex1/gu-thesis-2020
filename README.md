## README
This repository contains the code relating to the honours thesis written by Alex Gu under supervision of Dr. Ruth Knibbe, titled *"Predicting Perovskite Formation Energy using Machine Learning in the development of Oxygen Electrode Materials for High Temperature Electrolysis in Solid Oxide Fuel Cells"*.

### Requirements

* It is recommended to use the Anaconda distribution of Python as it comes with several handy features including Spyder and is tailored for data science, you can download it here: https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual.
* It is recommended (and generally good programming practice) to develop the code for this project in a seperate environment, furthermore, a list of requirements, `requirements.txt` outlines the packages which I have installed in the working version of my code.
 
To create an environment using these requirements, in the Anaconda terminal (search for this after installed), type:

`conda create --name <env> --file requirements.txt`


### Overview

* `data_preprocessing.py`
* `feature_importance.py`
* `model_svm.py`
